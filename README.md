# CIFAR-10 Model Comparison by Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms
 
In this project, I conducted experiments with several semi-supervised learning algorithms using convolutional neural networks. In the experiment, I considered the following semi-supervised learning algorithms, Entropy Minimization, CutMix and MixUp. the experiemnts was conducted with the CIFAR-10, dataset. I perform these experiments by varying the number of labeled and unlabeled samples in the training dataset and test the performance of the model using the test set. Also presented results in terms of classiﬁcation accuracies, confusion matrices and loss function plots.

# Implement
* Implement a deep convolutional neural network using only the labeled training data and report its performance on the test data. (Baseline)
* Apply Entropy Minimization, for unlabeled data along with labeled data to train a semi- supervised learning model and report the performance on the test set.
* Apply data augmentation technique MixUp, on the training data and report the performance on the test set.
* Apply data augmentation technique CutMix, on the training data and report the performance on the test set.
* Apply all of the above semi-supervised learning techniques on the training data and report the performance on the test data.
* Conduct your experiments by varying the number of labeled and unlabeled samples.
